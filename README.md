# Installation
## poetry
The recommended way is to use poetry. 
Install following the [docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)

Once installed, make sure to create the virtual env and install the dependencies
```
poetry install
```

## Dependencies
You need to have ta-lib installed on your system, if you wish to use it to create technical indicators.
It is strongly recommended to use it, as it provides the best performance.
Installation instructions are available [here](https://github.com/TA-Lib/ta-lib-python#dependencies)

## Running notebooks
You are invited to run the notebooks directly in visual studio.
Make sure you are using the poetry env, and not a python env, as seen below:
